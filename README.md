# Tic-Tac-Connect
Android Studio  -  Google Workshop  - Code Sprint


Prompt:

    We strongly suggest you work in groups of 2-3 students.
    Feel free to use data structures, algorithms and parts of the Android SDK that we did not have time to cover in this course.
    If you are struggling for app ideas, a game that has simple rules but that is fun to play (most children's games fall into this category) might be a good source for inspiration.
    Many games require choosing from a finite number of options - these games tend to be well represented by a graph structure, and some of these can further be represented by trees.
    Make a clear plan with your group on how you will structure your time and code over the sprint. How will you communicate? How will you control source code?
    Do not underestimate the amount of time needed to create an app - although you will have some time to debug in the first half of the workshop, do make sure you start early to give yourself enough time to do your group's idea justice!
